Day 3: Structuring Scalable APIs
During the third day, participants will build an API for a ML/AI task that scales to higher data workloads and model pipelines. They delegate longer tasks to worker processes. They expose and expose ML models through clear and consistent, testable endpoints. Typical issues with maintaining APIs and models are adressed.



Nikita:
- streaming requests and responses
