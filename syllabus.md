Day 2: Data Access and Storage
On this day, participants extend the data layer of their application by adding endpoints and schemas for creating, uploading and reading datasets. They connect a database and structure the code following best practices for modularized code and documentation.

Module 2.1: Data-centric APIs

- nesting and inheriting models
- get / put / update / delete endpoints
- requesting paginated data
- filtering
- JSON payloads, form and file uploads
- performance considerations

Module 2.2: Database connections

- object serialization with JSON
- serialization to SQL
- migrating databases and models
- the Repository pattern
- Object-Relational Mappers (ORM)
      
Module 2.3: Structuring an API

- creating a clean project structure
- separating API, service, and data layers
- the BCE Design Pattern
- grouping routes in a module
- testing a larger Python package
- exercise: organize pre- and postprocessing steps in a separate function

Day 3: Structuring Scalable APIs
During the third day, participants will build an API for a ML/AI task that scales to higher data workloads and model pipelines. They delegate longer tasks to worker processes. They expose and expose ML models through clear and consistent, testable endpoints. Typical issues with maintaining APIs and models are adressed.



Nikita:
- streaming requests and responses
- connecting to a secondary, external API
