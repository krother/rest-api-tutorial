## CHAPTER I: APOLOGETIC

I presume the reader is fond of the domestic cat; if only for the simple reason that God made it. Yes; God made it, and man mars it. Pussy is an ill-used, much persecuted, little understood, and greatly slandered animal. It is with the view of gaining for our little fireside friend a greater meed of justice than she has hitherto obtained, of removing the ban under which she mostly lives, and making her life a more pleasant and happy one, that the following pages are written.

## CHAPTER II: PUSSY ON HER NATIVE HEARTH

There really is a great deal of the woman's nature in the cat. Like a woman, pussy prefers a settled home to leading a roving life. Like a true woman, she is fond of fireside comforts. Then she is so gentle in all her ways, so kind, so loving, and so forgiving. On your return from business, the very look of her honest face, as she sits purring on the hearth-rug, with the pleasant adjuncts of a bright fire and hissing tea-urn, tends to make you forget all the cares of the day.

When you are dull and lonely, how often does her mirth-provoking attitudes and capers banish ennui. And if you are ill, how carefully she will watch by your bedside and keep you company. How her low song will lull you, her soft caresses soothe you, giving you more real consolation from the looks of concern exhibited on her loving little face, than any language could convey.

Pussy, from the very day she opens her wondering eyes and stares vacantly around her, becomes an object worthy of study and observation. Indeed, kittens, even before their eyes are opened, will know your voice or hand, and spit at a stranger's. The first year of pussy's existence is certainly the happiest. No creature in the world is so fond of fun and mischief as a kitten. Everything that moves or is movable, from its mother's tail to the table-cloth, must minister to its craze for a romp.

## CHAPTER III: PUSSY'S LOVE OF CHILDREN

A bond of natural affection seems to exist between children and cats. In many old-fashioned families, one of the children's first lessons consists in being taught to stroke puss the right way of the fur, and the child that is cruel to animals is sure to get well whipped for his pains.

Cats know at once if a child likes them or not, and are also quite aware if the child will treat them kindly. But a cat does not care to be nursed by a strange child. It does not object so much to be nursed even against its will by a child it knows. No affectionate child ever yet came to any harm from nursing cats, and probably the cat itself receives more benefit from the practice than the child does.

## CHAPTER V: SAGACITY OF CATS

Cats can easily be taught to be polite and well-mannered. It depends upon yourself, whether you allow your favourite to sit either on your shoulder or on the table at meal-times, or to wait demurely on the hearth till you have finished. In any case, her appetite should never get the better of her good manners.

"We always teach our cats," writes a lady to me, "to wait patiently while the family are at their meals, after which they are served. Although we never keep a dish for them standing in a corner, as some people do, yet we never had a cat-thief. Our Tom and Topsy used to sit on a chair beside my brother, near the table, with only their heads under the level of it. They would peep up occasionally to see if the meal were nearly over; but on being reminded that their time had not come, they would immediately close their eyes and feign to be asleep."

Poor old Tom knew the time my brother came in from business, and if five or ten minutes past his time, he would go to the door and listen, then come back to the fireside showing every symptom of impatience and anxiety. He knew the footsteps of every member of the family, and would start up, before the human ear could detect a sound, and hasten to the door to welcome the comer.

## CHAPTER IX: TENACITY OF LIFE IN CATS

Cats have a wonderful power of righting themselves when falling from a height. They always fall on their feet, and seldom injure themselves severely. A cat has been known to fall from the top of a five-storey building and walk away apparently uninjured.

The nine lives attributed to cats in popular tradition have some basis in fact. Their remarkable ability to survive falls, their agility in escaping danger, and their general hardiness contribute to this reputation. A cat's flexible spine, strong legs, and instinctive ability to twist in mid-air all work together to protect them from harm.

## CHAPTER XII: PUSSY AS A MOTHER

Cats of the right sort never fail to bring their kittens up in the way they should go, and soon succeed in teaching them all they know themselves. They will bring in living mice for them, and always take more pride in the best warrior-kitten than in the others. They will also inculcate the doctrine of cleanliness in their kits, so that the carpet shall never be wet.

I have often been amused at seeing my own cat bringing kitten after kitten to the sand-box, and showing it how to use it, in action explaining to them what it was there for. When a little older, she entices them out to the garden.

Mothers will sometimes correct their very young kittens; for instance, if it squeals when she wants to get away for a short time, two or three smart pats with a mittened paw generally make it go fast asleep.

## CHAPTER XIV: FISHING EXPLOITS

Many cats are excellent fishers. They will sit for hours by the side of a stream, watching for fish, and when one comes within reach, they strike it out of the water with lightning speed. The cat's patience in fishing rivals that of any human angler.

Some cats have been known to dive for fish, though this is rare. The fishing cat of Asia is particularly adept at this, but even domestic cats in fishing villages often learn the art. A fisherman's cat in Scotland was famous for bringing home her own catch every day.

## CHAPTER XVI: HUNTING EXPLOITS

The cat is essentially a hunter. Even the most pampered house cat retains the instincts of its wild ancestors. Given the opportunity, it will stalk, chase, and capture prey with remarkable skill.

A cat hunting is a study in patience and precision. It may watch a mouse hole for hours without moving, its eyes fixed, every muscle tensed and ready. When the moment comes, it strikes with incredible speed and accuracy. This hunting instinct is so strong that cats will "hunt" toys, strings, and even shadows with the same intensity they would apply to real prey.

## CHAPTER II (VOL. II): CLASSIFICATION AND POINTS

The domestic cat belongs to the family Felidae, which includes lions, tigers, and leopards. Despite its small size, the house cat shares many characteristics with its larger relatives, including retractable claws, excellent night vision, and a carnivorous diet.

Cats come in many varieties. The long-haired cats, such as the Persian, are prized for their beautiful coats. The short-haired varieties are generally more active and better hunters. Tabby cats, with their distinctive striped patterns, are perhaps the most common, while solid-coloured cats—black, white, orange, or grey—each have their devoted admirers.

## CHAPTER III: PUSSY'S PATIENCE AND CLEANLINESS

No animal is cleaner than the cat. She spends a large portion of her waking hours in grooming herself, keeping her fur in perfect condition. This cleanliness extends to her personal habits; a properly trained cat is the most fastidious of pets.

The cat's patience is legendary. She will wait motionless for incredible lengths of time when stalking prey or watching for an opportunity. This patience, combined with her natural curiosity, makes her an excellent problem-solver. Many a cat has learned to open doors, turn on taps, or find hidden treats through patient observation and experimentation.

## CHAPTER VII: FELINE AILMENTS

The most common ailments affecting cats include digestive troubles, skin conditions, and respiratory infections. A healthy cat should have bright eyes, a clean coat, and an alert demeanor. Any change in these characteristics may indicate illness.

Prevention is better than cure. A well-fed cat, kept in clean surroundings with access to fresh water and regular exercise, will rarely fall ill. The diet should consist primarily of meat, as cats are obligate carnivores and cannot thrive on a vegetarian diet.

Regular grooming helps prevent hairballs and skin problems. Long-haired cats especially benefit from daily brushing. Teeth should be checked periodically, as dental problems can lead to more serious health issues.
